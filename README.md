# Food Consumption and Comparative Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains research and analysis related to the food consumption patterns of the Bukidnon population in the Philippines, along with a comparative study of the general GDP and average school years between the Philippines and the United States (USA). The primary aim of this project is to better understand the nutritional needs and deficiencies in Bukidnon and propose potential policies to address these issues.

## Data Sources
### Food Consumption Data
The food consumption data for the Bukidnon population was collected from local surveys and government reports.
It includes information on the types and quantities of food consumed by different demographic groups within Bukidnon.
### Comparative Analysis Data
Data on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the Philippines and the USA was obtained from the World Bank or other reliable sources.
Data on the average number of school years for both countries was also sourced from reputable databases.
## Analysis and Findings
### Food Consumption Patterns in Bukidnon
The analysis of food consumption patterns in Bukidnon revealed potential deficiencies in certain essential nutrients.
Common dietary practices, regional preferences, and socio-economic factors were taken into account.
### Comparative Analysis between Philippines and USA
The comparative analysis showed significant disparities in GDP and education levels between the Philippines and the USA.
These differences provide context for understanding the economic and educational challenges faced by Bukidnon residents.
### Proposed Policy Recommendations
Addressing Nutritional Deficiencies
Based on the findings related to food consumption patterns in Bukidnon, we propose the development and implementation of targeted nutritional programs.
These programs should focus on improving access to nutritious foods and educating the population on balanced diets.
### Socio-Economic Development
Recognizing the disparities between the Philippines and the USA in terms of GDP and education, we recommend policies that promote economic growth and enhance educational opportunities in Bukidnon.
Initiatives to stimulate economic development and improve access to quality education can help alleviate poverty and enhance the overall well-being of the population.
